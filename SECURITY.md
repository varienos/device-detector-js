## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **Do not open a public issue.**
2. Submit a private report via GitHub Security Advisories ("Report a vulnerability" button on the repo).
3. Alternatively, email security@varienos.dev with detailed reproduction steps and impact.
4. You will receive acknowledgement within 3 business days. We aim to provide a fix or mitigation plan within 14 days, depending on severity.

When a fix is available, maintainers will coordinate disclosure, publish a patched release, and document remediation steps in the changelog or release notes.
